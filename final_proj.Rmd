head(election.emissions)
```

```{r}
reduced.emissions <- subset(election.emissions, select = -c(1,2))
ggpairs(reduced.emissions)
```

Remove outliers
- Loving county Texas, tiny population and household income, massive emissions
- Billings county, ND, fully white population
```{r}
r.election.emissions <- election.emissions[-c(1023,139),]
```


Fit first model using proportion of county that voted democrat
```{r}
basic.emissions.lm <- lm(log1p(emissions) ~ log(household_income) + log(1-prop_pop_white) + region + prop_dem, data=r.election.emissions)
summary(basic.emissions.lm)
vif(basic.emissions.lm)
anova(basic.emissions.lm)
AIC(basic.emissions.lm)
```

Fit second model using county winning party instead of democrat proportion for comparison
```{r}
indicator.emissions.lm <- lm(log1p(emissions) ~ log(household_income) + log(1-prop_pop_white) + region + winning_party, data=r.election.emissions)
summary(indicator.emissions.lm)
vif(indicator.emissions.lm)
anova(indicator.emissions.lm)
AIC(indicator.emissions.lm)
```

Fit residual plots to check assumptions
```{r}
resid_xpanel(basic.emissions.lm, smoother=TRUE)
resid_panel(basic.emissions.lm, plots=c("resid","qq"))
```
Add a squared household income term as is slightly indicated in above plots
```{r}
sq.income.emissions.lm <- lm(log1p(emissions) ~ log(household_income) + I(log(household_income)^2) + log(1-prop_pop_white) + region + prop_dem, data=r.election.emissions)
summary(sq.income.emissions.lm)
vif(sq.income.emissions.lm)
anova(sq.income.emissions.lm)
AIC(sq.income.emissions.lm)
```

Test significance of adding the quadratic term
```{r}
anova(basic.emissions.lm, sq.income.emissions.lm)
```
Create residual panels to check assumptions
```{r}
resid_xpanel(sq.income.emissions.lm, smoother=TRUE)
resid_panel(sq.income.emissions.lm, plots=c("resid","qq"))
```


Check confidence intervals for variables
```{r}
confint(sq.income.emissions.lm)
```

Check to see if region (area of the country) has a significant effect on the model
```{r}
no.region.lm <- lm(log1p(emissions) ~ log(household_income) + I(log(household_income)^2) + log(1-prop_pop_white) + prop_dem, data=r.election.emissions)
anova(no.region.lm, sq.income.emissions.lm)
```

Check VIF of quantitative variables to assess collinearity
```{r}
quant.emissions.lm <- lm(log(emissions+1) ~ log(household_income) + log(1-prop_pop_white) + prop_dem, data=r.election.emissions)
vif(quant.emissions.lm)
```
